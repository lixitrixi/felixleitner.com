During the summer before my Junior year, I began diving deeper into the developer side of Discord. My friends often used bots to play music from YouTube while we spent time on a call, and I thought it would be a fun project to make one myself. I also saw a need for some additional features such as personal playlists, and so I decided to create Arpeggio.
<h1>What I learned</h1>
Creating this larger bot (I had created simple bots before) gave me more insight into grouping bot commands and keeping a clean workspace. I used GCP to keep the bot running, and from that learned a bit more about using Virtual Machines to run code online. Seeing my bot running on its own, responding to commands and joining voice channels to play music, was a very rewarding experience. While Arpeggio is no longer online, I intend to create an improved bot in the future, building on what I learned making this one.
