Ropes is a simple physics simulation I created with inspiration from the game Polybridge and a video by YouTuber Sebastian Lague. It uses two simple objects - a node and a stick, to create complex movement. I created it using Pygame, a python game engine. It implements features like stress and wall collisions, and the simple behaviour of all the elements can be compounded to even simulate hanging cloth.

Node: moves through space and is affected by gravity
Stick: connects two nodes, snapping them to a set distance (its length) apart each frame.

One of my favorite parts of this project was implementing the extra features such as grid placement and stress. It forced me to approach problems from different angles and try multiple approaches. Whenever I added a new feature, I had to figure out how it would fit into the existing program, which kept me thinking creatively.
