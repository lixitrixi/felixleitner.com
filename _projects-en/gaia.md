Gaia is a long-term political roleplay I took part in with 4 other friends over the course of two years. Each member played the part of a country on a fictional world called Gaia. We made treaties, developed advanced technology, declared war, gathered raw resources, and even travelled to other planets to establish colonies. I had not held much intersted in 4X games like Civilization or Hearts of Iron before, but found myself very invested in this game. We used discord to write speeches and international news reports, and most of us also used design applications like Gravit to create flags and art of our countries' scenic views. I was also able to use my programming knowledge to help the game in some ways, like creating simple dice-rolling applications to simulate elections.
