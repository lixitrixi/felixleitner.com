Tictac10 is a program that uses game-playing AI to play tic-tac-toe on larger board sizes. I created it as a study of Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence as a whole. My inspiration came when I hit a particularly difficult level involving tic-tac-toe in a video game I was playing.

It uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to calculate the best move each turn, looking multiple rounds ahead. A huge motivation for me while initially creating this program was how well it worked. I let my parents playtest it and was blown away when it won against them every time.

Tictac10 is an ongoing project as I am continuing to improve the algorithmâ€™s speed to make smoother gameplay possible. I intend to develop an original board game and a similar AI to play it for my AP CSP exam at the end of this year. I've always been interested in AI and have completed smaller projects through classes and summer programs, but tictac10 is my largest project so far.
