Near the beginning of my second quarter at school, my english class began a new project focused on innovative thinking and introducing students to the steps necessary to create a successful business. Participating groups created concepts for new products for which they saw a demand in the school community. These products could be realistic or science fiction, as was the one that my partner and I decided on: the HackPack. Our concept for the product was a futuristic backpack which could hold a limitless number of items using a pocket dimension. 

While our product may have been an abstract idea, we still needed a tangible place to showcase it as well as favorable (although wholly fictional) customer reviews. As I was then only starting off with web design, I decided to create a simple website from scratch as a learning experience for myself.

<h1>What I learned</h1>
While I had dipped into HTML and CSS before, this was my first full project using those skills. I learned several useful CSS concepts as well as how to cleanly structure HTML. On the visual side, I learned more about what works on a web page and what doesn't, and I continue to build on this knowledge in current projects.
