I've always been interested in game development as a combination of art and computer science. In July of 2020, I began being seriously interested in making a game completely by myself, and so began to learn art. Through tutorials by AdamCYounis on Youtube, I learned the basics of pixel art and animation. This animation of a walking tax collector is my first completed pixel art animation. There are also other examples of art I've completed, showcased below.
