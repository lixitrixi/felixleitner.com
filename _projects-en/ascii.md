ASCII is a small project I completed on a road trip. Using Pillow, a Python image processing library, the program can transform any image into a brightness map of ASCII characters corresponding to the alpha of each pixel in an image. The final output's width can also be set. This allows me to quickly make ASCII art from any given image.
<h1>What I learned</h1>
While this project was rather small, I still learned a bit more about how image files are structured and processed by libraries like Pillow. This will no doubt be useful in future projects.
