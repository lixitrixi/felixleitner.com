Ropes is a simple physics simulation I created in Pygame with inspiration from the game <a>https://polybridgegame.com/=a=Polybridge</a> and a video by YouTuber <a>https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague=a=Sebastian Lague</a>. It uses two simple objects - a node and a stick - to create complex movement.

Using these two simple objects, the program can simulate physical objects like pivots, catapults, and even cloth!
