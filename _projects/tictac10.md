This was my first proper dive into AI! After being unable to beat a level involving a 10x10 version of tic-tac-toe on a game I was playing (<a>https://amanita-design.net/games/machinarium.html=a=Machinarium</a>), I decided to simply build an AI that could beat it.

While working on the program, a good motivator was how well it worked. The AI went from making very bad moves and being laughed at (warmly) by my dad to consistently beating him at the game.

Tic-tac-toe is obviously not a very impressive game to make an AI for, but the process taught me a lot about very useful CS concepts, like recursive functions.
