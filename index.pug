  h1 Hi, I'm Felix!

  p I’m a software developer studying at the #[a(href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/") University of St Andrews] in Scotland. I’m interested in many different areas of CS, especially algorithm design, networking technology, and full-stack web design/development.

  p I'm currently interning at #[a(https://www.mathworks.com/) MathWorks] in Cambridge, England, working on software and platform testing. I previously interned at #[a(href="https://www.savant.com") Savant Systems] and #[a(href="https://www.trackx.tech/") TrackX Technology]; for more details see my #[a(href="/resume.pdf", target="_blank") résumé].

  p I enjoy maintaining and contributing to open-source projects, both in my free time and as part of my degree:
  ul.padx
    li I have contributed to the #[a(href="https://github.com/conjure-cp") Conjure] constraint programming project and am now mentoring incoming members. Past projects have included a rewrite of the main application using Rust, as well as a JavaScript client-side API to interact with solver AaS backends.
    li I maintain the #[a(href="https://github.com/lixitrixi/planning") Planning] Rust library for generic minimal action planning.
    li I contribute to the #[a(href="https://github.com/conjure-cp/uniplate") Uniplate] Rust library, a powerful tool for traversing and manipulating tree-like data structures.
