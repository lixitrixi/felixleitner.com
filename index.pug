  h1 Hi, I'm Felix!
  p I’m a software developer studying at the #[a(href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank") University of St Andrews] in Scotland. I’m interested in many different areas of CS, especially deterministic AI, networking technology, and full-stack web design/development.
  p Alongside my studies I do web development for #[a(href="https://www.loft.design/" target="_blank") Loft Design] and have interned at #[a(href="https://www.savant.com/" target="_blank") Savant Systems] and #[a(href="https://www.trackx.tech/" target="_blank") TrackX Technology]. I enjoy maintaining and contributing to open-source projects, both in my free time and as part of my degree:
  ul.padx
    li I have contributed to the #[a(href="https://github.com/conjure-cp" target="_blank") Conjure] constraint programming project and am now mentoring incoming members.
    li I maintain the #[a(href="https://github.com/lixitrixi/planning" target="_blank") Planning] Rust library for generic minimal action planning.
