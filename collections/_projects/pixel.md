I've always been interested in game development. It was, after all, the medium that first got me into programming through <a>https://scratch.mit.edu=a=Scratch</a>. While my knowledge of programming has grown a lot...my art skills have not, and so I took it upon myself to learn some pixel art. Through amazing sources like <a>https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamCYounis=a=Adam Younis</a>, an indie game dev who makes art, code, and music (the holy trinity), I learned a bit more about this retro art style. Below are some of the results of my explorations.
