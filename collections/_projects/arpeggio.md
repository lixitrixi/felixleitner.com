Arpeggio is an automated Discord user account ("bot") that plays audio tracks and music in voice channels. It was my first larger project that I saw through to completion, and was also my first introduction to talking with other developers online.

My first version of Arpeggio was a few files that I copied to and ran on a GCP machine. It taught me a lot about Python libraries as well as how servers actually work. Since then, I've moved it to the web server that hosts my website and continuously updated and maintained it, seeing it grow from a handful of Discord servers with my friends to <b>52</b> servers today! It now supports SoundCloud and Spotify as well as YouTube playback.

Arpeggio taught me a lot about project management <b>(priorities!)</b> and the technical side of the Internet. Seeing all of my friends use it regularly like they would a more popular music bot has been very rewarding, and I hope it can grow to help more people enjoy their time online.
